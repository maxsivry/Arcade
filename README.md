# This project was made by Max Ivry and Matt Rieger.
For the module 3 open ended, we built an arcade in cpp. 
Depending on the user input, main.cpp will run either hangman.py, mancala.py, or hangman.java.
For Module 3 concepts, we included the programming languages of Java, Python and PHP
We also used HTML and CSS. In main, we used cmd arguments to pass a variable to python programs and to java program
At the time of submission, there were a few input validation logic bugs.
We recycled some code from CS21. In Wordhunt, some code was written by Shea Gilmour. I have asked for her consent.
