        <h3>Mancala!</h3>
        <p>Mancala is Matt Rieger's creation. A bit of a vanity project, Matt originally attempted to do this as his final project in his python class many years ago, but utimately the product was too buggy to use</p>
        <p>Undeterred, years later Matt made good on his quest and finished this project, and is so excited to share it with you all.</p>
